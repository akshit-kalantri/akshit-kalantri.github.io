									<h3 class="major">Targeted Drug Delivery By Nanorobots Using Chemotaxis - Fall 2021</h3>
									<p>Targeted drug delivery is a new application of micro/nanorobots. It is particularly exciting because the micro/nanorobots can access almost every tissue of the human body and, thus, be used to deliver drugs to precise locations in precise quantities. This precise delivery of drugs avoids side effects that might be a result of the drugs reaching unintended tissues. A lot of research has been carried out about such drug delivery methods in the past few years. In this project, the leader-follower model of communication was used for targeted drug delivery using micro/nanorobots. First, a mathematical model was developed which dictates how the two types of micro/nanorobots move around. Then, two properties of this model, viz., equilibrium and consensus, were proven. Subsequently, simulations for this model were run in Python 3 and the two possible scenarios were compared.</p>

									<p>Here are some of the screenshots of the results that were obtained from this model:</p>

									<h3 class="major">Gaussian Processes for Handwritten Datas</h3>
									<p>This project employed Gaussian Process Regression to predict time series data, specifically generating a predicted trajectory of a handwritten letter “e”. To accomplish this, the time series data was segmented into the x and y components with respect to time and then rescaled to fit the domain [0,10]. Different kernels were used, squared exponential and rational quadratic, and their results both fitted well. Appropriate observation points are very important for Gaussian regression models. Too few will cause the prediction interval to be wide, and too many will cause the model to overfit. It was observed that Gaussian processes are well equipped to fit such data and can predict with a minimal error rate.</p>
